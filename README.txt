Simple responsive page based on grid, animated with jQuery.


Click on links in navbar to move through page sections (animated).

Click on arrow in header to fluidly move page window to carousel (animated).


For carousel I have used Slick slider -> https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick (customized styles).
