Test assignment from adikt-mobile http://adiktmobile.cz/

Very simple responsive page based on grid.
Click on links in navbar to scroll through page sections (animated).
Click on arrow in header to fluidly scroll page to carousel (animated).
JS is written in pure JavaScript but I've implemented jQuery for Slick.
For carousel I've used Slick slider -> https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick (customized styles).
Interaction of "Hamburger submenu" wasn't defined in PSD so it doesn't have any functionality.
HTML is compiled from Jade(Pug) templates -> https://github.com/pugjs/pug
CSS is compiled from SCSS based on BEM logic.
